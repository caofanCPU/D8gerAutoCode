Note: 1.D8ger-ALIGN(included by character '@') is the config keyword of this text,
      which these context included will be ignored;
      2.Multi-lines to be handled must include ','
      as the split keyword
      3.config example:
      - @<alignStyle=LEFT>@    , LEFT(default) and you can config CENTER, RIGHT too
      - @<algorithmType=1>@    , 1(default) as 'AES' and 2 as 'PinYin'
      - @<operateType=0>@      , 1 as encrypt, 2 as decrypt
                                 and 0(default) is encrypt + decrypt for complete
      4.As example below, one handled what you will find like this:
      first_name,       --> D8(first_name)        AS  firstName,
      current_age,      --> D8(current_age)       AS  currentAge,
      blog_url,         --> D8(blog_url)          AS  blogUrl,
      graduated_school, --> D8(graduated_school)  AS  graduatedSchool,
      total_assets      --> D8(total_assets)      AS  totalAssets
