Note: 1.D8ger-ALIGN(included by character '@') is the config keyword of this text,
      which these context included will be ignored;
      2.Multi-lines to be handled must include ','
      as the split keyword
      3.config example:
      - @<prefix=D8(>@         , add 'D8(' before the start of each line
      - @<suffix=)>@           , add ')' after the end of each line
      - @<alignStyle=LEFT>@    , you can config CENTER, RIGHT too
      - @<formatSQL=false>@    , if config SQL then it will append 'AS' alias name
      - @<formatAsCamel=false>@ , special for SQL column alias camel name
      4.As example below, one handled what you will find like this:
      first_name,       --> D8(first_name)        AS  firstName,
      current_age,      --> D8(current_age)       AS  currentAge,
      blog_url,         --> D8(blog_url)          AS  blogUrl,
      graduated_school, --> D8(graduated_school)  AS  graduatedSchool,
      total_assets      --> D8(total_assets)      AS  totalAssets
