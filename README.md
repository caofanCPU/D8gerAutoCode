## Attention
The latest version is **4.0** is submitted and under the official approval on 5th, February.  
If you can't fetch it, then [click here](https://github.com/caofanCPU/D8gerAutoCode/releases/tag/4.0) to download ~~.zip~~ file.  
Important: This version has been implemented [DSP(D8ger Series Plan)](https://www.processon.com/view/5f96a5f35653bb06ef1870e8).  
That is, some functions have been migrated to another plugin named [LaoYouTiao](https://github.com/caofanCPU/LaoYouTiao). After testing, installing two plugins will not affect performance. So, I hope you use happy and give me a üåü, thx!

### Preface
As JetBrains' said, I believe that you should be good use of tools will save you precious hours on your busing work.

I always wonder, "If someone else has already solved the repeating work, why do I need to repeat it again?"

Well, that's a valid question for my drive to find the repeat parts at daily work and develop this plugin to save my time.  

### [Quick Start](http://www.debuggerpowerzcy.top/home/2020/03/14/D8gerAutoCode%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/)
<a href="http://file.debuggerpowerzcy.top/power/html/IntelliJBestAction.html" target="_blank">ZNÁ®ãÂ∫èÂëòÁ¶èÂà©</a>

### Convention
- The general problem provides standard solutions
- The personalized problem only provides example solutions

### Original design intention
- Remove the fixed duplication coding for improving efficiency in development  
- Provide available code templates that can be used without modification  
- Support code directory configuration, only by self-guided package intelligent programming can be done in one-click  
- Support user-defined configuration, you can specify which file to be generated  

### Features

- ~~Camel-Underline-Uppercase-Uncapitalize-Lowercase can be converted to each other by shortcut~~ `alt` + `shift` + `cmd` + `U`
- The comments of generated codes support English(Default) | Chinese Simplified(Optional) configuration
- ~~JSON formatting and single line text conversion, supporting section and whole document, default shortcut~~ `alt`+`shift`+`cmd`+`J` | `S`
- Generating `data table definition SQL` | `Mo` | `Mapper` | `Handler`, single table addition, deletion, modification and search with paging in one click
- Under the help of SwaggerApi generating `Vo` | `Controller` with friendly document description, in addition to this, supporting `Vo` field automatic sorting
- For smart coding, you just need one shortcut default as `alt`+`shift`+`cmd`+`D`
- Supporting customer configuration, for example, specify the author who you are
- Reserve easter eggs, you can try to edit the blank file in IDEA and type `d8ger` to get the default configuration template
- ~~Reserve easter eggs, edit the blank file in IDEA and enter `nasa` to get the NASA configuration file template. This is very useful and efficient for handling multi-lines, especially SQL field naming processing.~~
- ~~Reserve easter eggs, edit the blank file in IDEA and enter `regex` to get some commonly used regular expressions. Other code Easter eggs will be added later.~~
- For automatic sorting `Vo` field , you just need one shortcut default as `alt`+`shift`+`cmd`+`O`

### Using manual(v3.0+)
1.Open the configuration box to set the generation parameters, `Preference` --> `Other Settings` --> `D8gerAutoCode`

2.Check the file to be generated and choose the generation path, rewrite `author`„ÄÅ`apiUrlPrefix` and `locale`, and click the button to save your configuration.  

<div align="center">
    <img src="http://file.debuggerpowerzcy.top/power/D8King.jpg" /> 
</div>

### Using manual(under v3.0)
1. Create Model Class

2. Select the class name and press the (default) shortcut `alt`+`shift`+`cmd`+`D`

3. Under the default configuration, `D8gerAutoCode` directory and `data table SQL definitions` and **Web codes** will be generated

4. So, What you need to do:
    - Under a multi-module project, configure the generated file output directory, for example, **`Mo.java`** should be moved into the `model` directory  
    - Add non-null constraints to **`xx.sql`** as required  
    - If you generated the **Controller.java** file, please note the interface returns type of **`Object`**, it should be modified to the project's uniform return type  
    - In the above steps the `xx.java` file will report some errors, ***don't worry***, these just require you to import packages

5. Default configuration file template for easter egg:
    - In the ***`resource`*** root directory of the module where the `Model class` is located, create `d8ger.properties` property configuration file
    - Type `d8ger` and click on `Tools`-> `D8ger`-> `D8gerMore`, and you will find some surprise

6. ~~Regex template for easter egg:~~
    - ~~Choose any blank file, Type `regex` and click on `Tools`-> `D8ger`-> `D8gerMore`, and you will find some surprise~~

7. ~~NASA template for easter egg:~~
    - ~~Choose any blank file, Type `nasa` and click on` Tools`-> `D8ger`-> `D8gerMore`, and you will get the NASA manual~~
    - ~~Follow the manual, custom your config and write your own multi-lines need to be batch handled, then you will find some surprise~~

8. ~~Camel-Underline-Uppercase-Uncapitalize-Lowercase circle convert by one-click~~
    - ~~Choose word text in any editing file, press `alt` + `shift` + `cmd` + `U`, you`ll find the changed word~~
    - ~~If not satisfied just press the shortcut again and again util you are.~~

9. You will get the following default configuration information
    - It's recommended that you change the configuration items
        - `author` (you can't sign my name for the pits you dug!)
        - `apiUrlPrefix` (the interface url prefix should be configured as the project interface unified URL prefix)
        - generate file output directory under a multi-module project
    - As for `boolean` configuration items, let you choose which files need to be generated, and specify output directory is optional

> By the way, these default shortcuts used in Mac OS, if you use Windows just take `cmd` into `ctrl`.

### How to install
- `Preference` --> `Plugins` --> `Marketplace` --> type `D8` --> install
- [IDEA official plugin library installation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13576-d8gerautocode)  
- As for `Source installation` requires you're familiar with Gradle, I will add more details about how to develop a plugin by ***Gradle*** later

### Bug & Question
- Known issues
> Modify the `d8ger.properties` file before generating code, the configuration file does not take effect

```
Solution
0. If you upgrade version 3.0+, you won`t see it again.
1. Because the IDEA file uses the VFS mechanism, as a plug-in to use the monitoring file I think it is not cost-effective  
2. I also found a reason aboub editing .properties file, sometimes it will take one or two minutes to refresh after you finished  
3. So, press `cmd` + `s` to force refreshing .properties file and you will solve it.

> The icon of plugin shows error like this: red square with a cross
<div align="center">
    <img src="http://file.debuggerpowerzcy.top/power/W-D8ger.png" /> 
</div>

```
Solution
1.This issue is caused by Intellij IDEA of new version feature.
2.Try to upgrade the version of Intellij util 2019.3.*(greater than 2019.2.*), you'll fix it.
